## Formatting
The python script `format.py` is useful for managing header comments and formatting.
You can format a single file, all files in a directory, or all files in a pre-specified directory. 
The script internally uses `clang-format`. You can format the source code in accordance with the style configuration file.
Check out the `help` menu for available options.

## File Description Headers
You can add or strip headers either to/from a specific file, or all files in a specific directory, or all the files in a pre-specified directory.
The code has options for these choices.
