    * unordered list, (level:1)

7. ordered list (level:0)
    3. ordered list (level:1)
        3. ordered list (level:2)
            - unordered list (level:3)
                * unordered list (level:4)
                - unordered list (level:4)
            + unordered list (level:3)
        1. ordered list (level:2)

<!--- use back-ticks (aka back-quotes) for highlighting --->
