## Building Peloton in Debug Mode

To build peloton with more debugging information, you should reconfigure `cmake` like this and build again :

```
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
make -j4
```

To enable logging information with more verbosity (generated by statements like `LOG_TRACE` and more verbose levels):

```
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-DLOG_LEVEL=LOG_LEVEL_TRACE" ..
make -j4
```

### Verbosity Levels

**LOG_LEVEL_TRACE** 	All log messages are printed. Note that this will significantly reduce the performance of the engine at runtime.  
**LOG_LEVEL_DEBUG** 	Only debug messages are printed.  
**LOG_LEVEL_INFO** 	Only info messages are printed. _This is the default log verbosity setting_.  
**LOG_LEVEL_WARN** 	Only warning messages are printed.  
**LOG_LEVEL_ERROR** 	Only fatal error messages are printed.  
**LOG_LEVEL_DISABLE** 	All output messages from the engine are suppressed.
